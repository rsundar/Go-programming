| ** MAP ** | ** STRUCT ** |
|---------|---------------|
| Pass by Reference | Pass by value |
| Can iterate over Keys | Cannot iterate Keys |
| All values must be of same type | Can have different types |
| Don't need to know all the keys at compile time | Need to know all the 'keys' at compile time |

In general Maps represent collections of similar key value types.

Whereas structs are far more general and represent the varied properties of a particular thing.
